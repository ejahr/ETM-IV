# ICEC-vibrational-motion
Interatomic Coulombic Electron Capture (ICEC) is an environment-mediated process in which a free electron attaches to a species by transferring excess energy to a neighbor. We incorporated the vibrational motion into an analytical model of the ICEC cross section, including both energy and electron transfer, and applied our theory to (HeNe)+.
